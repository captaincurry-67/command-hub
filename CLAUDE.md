# 5th Marine Regiment Command Hub — Project Context

**Context**: This file is auto-loaded into every Claude Code session in this folder. Claude built this entire project from scratch across earlier sessions. The user is a beginner web developer; explain things clearly, verify changes in the browser before declaring done, and always test locally with `wrangler dev --local` before deploying.

**Keep this file current**: whenever architecture, schema, routes, styling rules, or production data state change meaningfully, update the relevant section here in the same commit.

---

## 1. Architecture & Stack

- **Frontend**: Plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript. **No framework, no build step, no npm dependencies in the app.** Each page is an `.html` file with its own JS file. Shared helpers loaded as plain `<script>` tags (order matters: `api.js` → `nav.js` → `ranks.js` → page script).
- **Backend**: Single Cloudflare Worker (`src/worker.js`, ES module) handling all `/api/*` routes, session auth, and page gating, with static assets served via the `ASSETS` binding fallthrough.
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) — name `5thmr-command-hub-db`, id `c27e17f8-84c4-4f85-867d-22e342eed695`, bound as `DB`.
- **Auth**: Custom username/password. PBKDF2 (Web Crypto, SHA-256, 100k iterations, per-user 16-byte hex salt). Opaque 32-byte session tokens in a `sessions` table, cookie `session` (`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`, 14-day expiry). No JWT, no libraries.
- **Email**: Resend API (`fetch` to `https://api.resend.com/emails`), from `5th Marine Regiment Command Hub <onboarding@resend.dev>` (shared test domain — deliberate choice, user declined custom domain DNS). Secret `RESEND_API_KEY` set via wrangler.
- **Hosting/Deploy**: Cloudflare Workers, free tier. **`git push` to `main` auto-deploys** via Cloudflare Workers Builds (GitHub repo `captaincurry-67/command-hub` connected). Live URL: `https://command-hub.5thmrcommandhub.workers.dev`
- **Local dev**: `npx wrangler dev --local` on port 8787 (configured in `.claude/launch.json` as `command-hub-preview`). Local D1 state lives in `.wrangler/` (gitignored). The user's wrangler CLI is OAuth-logged-in as `captaincurryops@gmail.com` (account id `1a73f6294f7a66cbfb773324acc969f9`), so `--remote` D1 commands work non-interactively.
- **Git identity** (repo-local): `captaincurry-67` / `captaincurryops@gmail.com`. Working dir: `C:\Users\rakes\Desktop\command-hub` (Windows, PowerShell + Git Bash).

### wrangler.toml (exact, load-bearing)
```toml
name = "command-hub"
main = "src/worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-01"

[assets]
directory = "./public"
binding = "ASSETS"
run_worker_first = true
html_handling = "none"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "5thmr-command-hub-db"
database_id = "c27e17f8-84c4-4f85-867d-22e342eed695"
```
**Critical gotchas already solved — do not regress**: `run_worker_first = true` is required or the Worker's auth gating never runs for static pages. `html_handling = "none"` prevents `.html`-stripping redirects that break path-based gating, but it also disables `/` → `/index.html`, which the Worker handles manually in `serveAsset()`.

## 3. Global Styling & Variables

Theme matches the community's main site **5thmr.org**. All colors/fonts via CSS custom properties in `variables.css` — never hard-code.

```css
--color-bg: #161920;  --color-bg-panel: #202225;  --color-bg-panel-raised: #2b3237;
--color-header-bg: #161920cc;
--color-gold: #ebae46;  --color-gold-bright: #ffa100;  --color-sage: #8db1a1;
--color-text: #ffffff;  --color-text-muted: #a9b2ae;  --color-border: #333a3f;
--color-open: #4caf6e;  --color-closed: #e5484d;
--font-display / --font-body: "Jura", sans-serif;   /* Google Fonts, weights 400-700 */
--radius: 5px;
```
- Header brand: `5th Marine Regiment` **white** + `<span>Command Hub</span>` **gold** (`--color-gold`) — this exact split was user-corrected twice; don't change.
- Footer on every page: exactly `5th Marine Regiment Command Hub` (no tagline).
- Body background: `site-bg.jpg` under a dark gradient overlay, `background-attachment: fixed` was **removed** (caused scroll jank) — keep it `no-repeat`.
- Table headers: bold (`font-weight: 700`), dark text `#16191f` on gold backgrounds.
- Activity rating colors: `5:#3aa655, 4:#8bc34a, 3:#f6c343, 2:#f0973b, 1:#e2683a, 0:#e5484d, LOA:#ebae46`.
- Mobile: header stacks below 720px; wide tables wrap in `overflow-x: auto` containers (`.admin-table-scroll`, `.activity-table-scroll`).

## 4. Completed Components (all 100% done, tested locally, deployed live)

### Pages
- **Chain of Command** — org-chart of flat bordered tables (Regiment → Battalions → Companies) with gold connector lines, tier bars, rank icons; plus standalone Warrant Officers & Reserves tables (sage headers). Occupant names are **server-derived**, not stored in the page data.
- **Activity Report** — monthly grid: rows = all assigned officers in hierarchy order, **sectioned by unit** (gold section header rows: "Regimental Command", "Battalion I", "Company II"...), row label format `Title - Name` (e.g. `Lieutenant Colonel - Yukki`), columns = that month's Mondays (only up to today), trailing **Qtr Avg** that follows the viewed month's quarter. Prev/Next month nav, Next capped at current month. Only the **current week** is editable (dropdown 0–5/LOA, color-coded); everything else read-only. **All officers see everything; only rating rights are restricted.**
- **Admin** (Regimental Command only) — officer table (Name/Username/Email/Tier/Seat + Reassign + Remove-as-soft-deactivate), Add Officer form (display name, username, email, tier, vacant-seat dropdown; shows temp password once), and the structure-only Hierarchy editor (rank dropdown with icon preview, title, Closed checkbox; add/remove battalions/companies/positions; single Save Changes writes whole JSON). Warrant Officers/Reserves sections still use the old name+status editor (intentionally).
- **Login / Setup / Reset-password** — setup self-disables once any officer exists; reset flow is email token → new password → invalidates all sessions.

### Data model (all migrations already applied to local AND production)
- `officers`: + `display_name`, `current_position_id` (seat link), `is_active` (soft delete). Login/session queries filter `is_active = 1`.
- `hierarchy` (single row id=1): structure-only JSON — positions are `{id, rank, title, closed}`. **No names stored.** `GET /api/hierarchy` enriches with occupant names by joining `officers.current_position_id`; `PUT` strips any `name`/`status` fields before saving. Warrant Officers/Reserves sections still carry `{rank,title,name,status}` (out of scope for seat-linking).
- `activity_ratings`: `(officer_id, week_start UNIQUE)` pairs, rating TEXT `'0'..'5'|'LOA'`, `rated_by`, upserted via `ON CONFLICT`.
- Promotions = `POST /api/officers/:id/assign` (just changes `current_position_id`; same login, ratings history untouched). No backdating.

### Rating permission matrix (server-enforced in worker.js — the core business rule)
Rank groups: `regimental` (O-6..O-9), `battalion` (O-4/O-5), `captain` (O-3), `lieutenant` (O-1/O-2).
```js
const RATE_TARGETS = {
  regimental: ["battalion", "captain", "lieutenant"],
  battalion:  ["battalion", "captain", "lieutenant"],  // incl. battalion peers
  captain:    ["captain", "lieutenant"],               // any company incl. own
  lieutenant: [],                                      // can rate nobody
};
// No self-rating anywhere. Regimental seats appear as rows but are never rateable.
// PUT /api/activity/rating also rejects any weekStart !== current Monday (ISO date).
```
Weeks are computed on the fly (`mondayOf()` UTC); nothing pre-generated. Quarter = calendar quarter of the *viewed* month.

### API routes (all in src/worker.js)
`GET /api/setup-status`, `POST /api/setup` (only when 0 officers), `POST /api/login`, `POST /api/logout`, `GET /api/me`, `GET|PUT /api/hierarchy`, `GET /api/positions` (flattened seats w/ occupancy for admin dropdowns), `GET|POST /api/officers`, `POST /api/officers/:id/assign`, `DELETE /api/officers/:id` (soft), `POST /api/request-reset`, `POST /api/reset-password`, `GET /api/activity?month=YYYY-MM`, `PUT /api/activity/rating`.

### Production data state
8 live officer accounts, all linked to seats:
| username | display_name | seat |
|---|---|---|
| ColCurry | Curry | reg-pos-5 |
| MajGHoms | Hombrger | reg-pos-2 |
| BGenKim | Kenobi | reg-pos-3 |
| ColConnie | Connie | reg-pos-4 |
| LtColYukki | Yukki | bn-1-pos-1 |
| MajSpaceBall | SpaceBall | bn-1-pos-2 |
| CaptAlex | Alex | bn1-co-1-pos-1 |
| CaptGatto | Gatto | bn1-co-2-pos-1 |

Position id scheme: `reg-pos-1..5`, `bn-1-pos-1..2`, `bn1-co-1-pos-1..5`, `bn1-co-2-pos-1..5`, `bn-2-pos-1..2`, `bn2-co-1-pos-1..5`, `bn2-co-2-pos-1..5`. Closed: `reg-pos-1` (O-9) and everything under Battalion II.

Local D1 test accounts (local only, wiped/recreated freely): `testrc / TestPass1234` (regimental), plus testbattalion/testcaptain1/testcaptain2 with temp passwords from that session — recreate as needed.

Last commit: `bd5b2c7` "Activity Report: full visibility, Title - Name rows, unit sections" — deployed and verified live.

## 5. Current State & Active Bugs

- **No active bugs.** Last edits (`src/worker.js` `apiGetActivity`, `public/assets/js/activity-report.js`, `public/assets/css/activity.css`) implemented the three user corrections: full visibility for all tiers, `Title - Name` row format, unit section header rows. All verified locally and confirmed deployed (grepped live JS for `activity-section-row`).
- Working tree is clean; everything is committed and pushed.
- Note: `resolveViewerGroup()` in worker.js falls back to tier-based group if an officer has no seat; `VISIBLE_GROUPS` constant was removed when visibility opened up.

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

1. **User action pending — remind them**: create accounts in Admin for the 6 seats still showing OPEN on the live Chain of Command: Massa (`bn1-co-1-pos-2`), Skeletonpilot (`bn1-co-1-pos-3`), Mizer (`bn1-co-1-pos-4`), Eli (`bn1-co-2-pos-2`), x2Hello (`bn1-co-2-pos-3`), Hammad (`bn1-co-2-pos-4`).
2. **Bulk import of historical activity ratings** — user has an Excel "Activity Sheet" (weekly 0–5/LOA ratings, weeks starting 22/6/26) and promised to send the full export. When received: map names → officer ids, week columns → Monday ISO dates, generate INSERT statements into `activity_ratings` (respect the `UNIQUE(officer_id, week_start)` constraint), apply with `npx wrangler d1 execute 5thmr-command-hub-db --remote --file=...`. Dates in their sheet are DD/M/YY.
3. **Ideas previously suggested, not yet requested/built** (raise only if user asks for more analytics): unit-level average rollups, ↑/↓ trend indicators, "needs attention" flags for consecutive low ratings, CSV export.

### Operational reference
- Local dev: `npx wrangler d1 execute 5thmr-command-hub-db --local --file=db/schema.sql` (first time), then `npx wrangler dev --local` → http://localhost:8787.
- Remote DB queries: same command with `--remote` (works non-interactively; wrangler is OAuth-authed).
- Deploy = commit + `git push` (Workers Builds picks it up in ~60s). Never edit the D1 production data without also updating `src/seed-hierarchy.json` when the hierarchy *structure* changes.
- Browser-verify changes at mobile width too (375px) — overflow regressions have bitten twice (fixed via scroll-wrapper pattern).
