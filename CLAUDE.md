# 5th Marine Regiment Command Hub — Project Context

**Context**: This file is auto-loaded into every Claude Code session in this folder. Claude built this entire project from scratch across earlier sessions. The user is a beginner web developer; explain things clearly, verify changes in the browser before declaring done, and always test locally with `wrangler dev --local` before deploying.

**Keep this file current**: whenever architecture, schema, routes, styling rules, or production data state change meaningfully, update the relevant section here in the same commit.

---

## 1. Architecture & Stack

- **Frontend**: Plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JavaScript. **No framework, no build step, no npm dependencies in the app.** Each page is an `.html` file with its own JS file. Shared helpers loaded as plain `<script>` tags (order matters: `api.js` → `nav.js` → `ranks.js` → page script).
- **Backend**: Single Cloudflare Worker (`src/worker.js`, ES module) handling all `/api/*` routes, session auth, and page gating, with static assets served via the `ASSETS` binding fallthrough.
- **Database**: Cloudflare D1 (SQLite) — name `5thmr-command-hub-db`, id `c27e17f8-84c4-4f85-867d-22e342eed695`, bound as `DB`.
- **Auth**: Custom username/password. PBKDF2 (Web Crypto, SHA-256, 100k iterations, per-user 16-byte hex salt). Opaque 32-byte session tokens in a `sessions` table, cookie `session` (`HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax`, 14-day expiry). No JWT, no libraries.
- **Email**: Resend API (`fetch` to `https://api.resend.com/emails`), from `5th Marine Regiment Command Hub <onboarding@resend.dev>` (shared test domain — deliberate choice, user declined custom domain DNS). Secret `RESEND_API_KEY` set via wrangler.
- **Server Stats data**: a Discord bot appends every server join/leave to a Google Sheet (raw log in cols A–C: `Date` `DD/MM/YYYY HH:MM:SS`, `User`, `Join/Leave`; cols E–I hold the user's manual daily summary, which the Worker ignores — everything is computed from the raw log). Published-as-CSV URL: `https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQUy5ynqu6dUacmXDa-k-48MLqFbab0la0NhdQE4IYEobjYAI_5ASnO-aRTM5ZyEWbcBGQj92GJ59y5/pub?gid=1392691594&single=true&output=csv` — stored as secret `SHEET_CSV_URL` (prod: wrangler secret; local: `.dev.vars`, gitignored). The Worker fetches + parses it in `/api/server-stats` with a 5-min in-isolate cache. Prod secret set 2026-07-18. 1,683 events since 21 Feb 2026 (incl. a backfilled 10–18 Jul gap: 42 exact joins recovered from Discord member data + 114 leaves spread evenly across the gap — see `G:\1. Claude Projects\discord-stats-bot\backfill.js`).
- **The Discord bot itself** ("StatsReader", discord.js): hosted on **SparkedHost** — billing at billing.sparkedhost.com ("Basic Bot Hosting", ₹90.95/mo), panel at control.sparkedhost.us (server `02eb41ce`, "Login via Billing" SSO). It POSTs `{type, user}` to a Google Apps Script web app that appends the sheet row (the Apps Script stamps the date — so backfills must be pasted into the sheet directly, not POSTed). **It went down 10–18 Jul because the hosting was suspended over an unpaid invoice** — if Server Stats "Last 7 Days" ever shows all zeros, check SparkedHost billing first. A local backup copy lives at `G:\1. Claude Projects\discord-stats-bot\` (`start-bot.bat` auto-restart launcher; token hardcoded in `index.js`) — never run it while the hosted bot is up or every event logs twice.
- **Hosting/Deploy**: Cloudflare Workers, free tier. **`git push` to `main` auto-deploys** via Cloudflare Workers Builds (GitHub repo `captaincurry-67/command-hub` connected). Live URL: `https://command-hub.5thmrcommandhub.workers.dev`
- **Local dev**: `npx wrangler dev --local` on port 8787 (configured in `.claude/launch.json` as `command-hub-preview`). Local D1 state lives in `.wrangler/` (gitignored). The user's wrangler CLI is OAuth-logged-in as `captaincurryops@gmail.com` (account id `1a73f6294f7a66cbfb773324acc969f9`), so `--remote` D1 commands work non-interactively.
- **Git identity** (repo-local): `captaincurry-67` / `captaincurryops@gmail.com`. Working dir: `G:\1. Claude Projects\command-hub` (Windows, PowerShell + Git Bash; moved from Desktop 2026-07-18).

### wrangler.toml (exact, load-bearing)
```toml
name = "command-hub"
main = "src/worker.js"
compatibility_date = "2024-09-01"

[assets]
directory = "./public"
binding = "ASSETS"
run_worker_first = true
html_handling = "none"

[[d1_databases]]
binding = "DB"
database_name = "5thmr-command-hub-db"
database_id = "c27e17f8-84c4-4f85-867d-22e342eed695"
```
**Critical gotchas already solved — do not regress**: `run_worker_first = true` is required or the Worker's auth gating never runs for static pages. `html_handling = "none"` prevents `.html`-stripping redirects that break path-based gating; `/` never reaches `serveAsset()` — `fetch()` 302s it (and `/index.html`, and logged-in `/login.html` visits) to login or chain-of-command. There is no Home page (removed 2026-07-18 at user request).

## 3. Global Styling & Variables

Theme matches the community's main site **5thmr.org**. All colors/fonts via CSS custom properties in `variables.css` — never hard-code.

```css
--color-bg: #161920;  --color-bg-panel: #202225;  --color-bg-panel-raised: #2b3237;
--color-header-bg: #161920cc;
--color-gold: #ebae46;  --color-gold-bright: #ffa100;  --color-sage: #8db1a1;
--color-text: #ffffff;  --color-text-muted: #a9b2ae;  --color-border: #333a3f;
--color-open: #4caf6e;  --color-closed: #e5484d;
--font-display / --font-body: "Jura", sans-serif;   /* Google Fonts, weights 400-700 */
--radius: 5px;
```
- Header brand: `5th Marine Regiment` **white** + `<span>Command Hub</span>` **gold** (`--color-gold`) — this exact split was user-corrected twice; don't change.
- Footer on every page: exactly `5th Marine Regiment Command Hub` (no tagline).
- Body background: `site-bg.jpg` under a dark gradient overlay, `background-attachment: fixed` was **removed** (caused scroll jank) — keep it `no-repeat`.
- Table headers: bold (`font-weight: 700`), dark text `#16191f` on gold backgrounds.
- Activity rating colors: `5:#3aa655, 4:#8bc34a, 3:#f6c343, 2:#f0973b, 1:#e2683a, 0:#e5484d, LOA:#ebae46`.
- Mobile: header stacks below 720px; wide tables wrap in `overflow-x: auto` containers (`.admin-table-scroll`, `.activity-table-scroll`).

## 4. Completed Components (all 100% done, tested locally, deployed live)

### Pages
- **Chain of Command** — org-chart of flat bordered tables (Regiment → Battalions → Companies) with gold connector lines, tier bars, rank icons; plus standalone Warrant Officers & Reserves tables (sage headers). Occupant names are **server-derived**, not stored in the page data.
- **Activity Report** — monthly grid: rows = all assigned officers in hierarchy order, **sectioned by unit** (gold section header rows: "Regimental Command", "Battalion I", "Company II"...), row label format `Title - Name` (e.g. `Lieutenant Colonel - Yukki`), columns = that month's Mondays (only up to today), trailing **Qtr Avg** that follows the viewed month's quarter. Prev/Next month nav, Next capped at current month. Only the **current week** is editable (dropdown 0–5/LOA, color-coded); everything else read-only. **All officers see everything; only rating rights are restricted.**
- **Admin** (Regimental Command only) — officer table (Name/Username/Email/Tier/Seat + Reassign + Remove-as-soft-deactivate), Add Officer form (display name, username, email, tier, vacant-seat dropdown; shows temp password once), and the structure-only Hierarchy editor (rank dropdown with icon preview, title, Closed checkbox; add/remove battalions/companies/positions; single Save Changes writes whole JSON). Warrant Officers/Reserves sections still use the old name+status editor (intentionally).
- **Login / Setup / Reset-password** — setup self-disables once any officer exists; reset flow is email token → new password → invalidates all sessions.
- **Server Stats** — visible to all logged-in officers; an analytics dashboard over the Discord join/leave log. Panels top to bottom: meta line (tracking since / events / unique users / last entry / skipped rows); 4 stat cards (Last 7 Days, Last 30 Days, All Time — each Joins green `#3aa655` / Leaves red `#e5484d` / Net gold — plus Retention: median stay, % left within 7 days, rejoined users); **daily chart** "Joins, Leaves & Intake — Last 30 Days" (grouped bars + smoothed gold `#ebae46` intake/net line + thin dashed linear trendlines per series — mirrors the user's Google Sheets chart); **weekly chart** (12 Monday-start weeks, bars only); **Member Growth** cumulative-net line with gold area fill and nearest-point hover marker; Monthly Summary table; Recent Activity table (last 25, Join/Leave badges). Leave bars are stripe-textured for colorblind safety; all charts share one tooltip div, use responsive `viewBox` SVGs (min 640px, scroll wrapper on mobile). All aggregation is server-side in `apiServerStats` (`buildServerStats`/`buildRetention` in worker.js — retention pairs each user's Join with their next Leave into "stints"). CSV parsing handles quoted fields, header-row column detection, day-first slash dates (auto-detects order when a day > 12 appears), ISO dates, and skips unreadable rows.

### Data model (all migrations already applied to local AND production)
- `officers`: + `display_name`, `current_position_id` (seat link), `is_active` (soft delete). Login/session queries filter `is_active = 1`.
- `hierarchy` (single row id=1): structure-only JSON — positions are `{id, rank, title, closed}`. **No names stored.** `GET /api/hierarchy` enriches with occupant names by joining `officers.current_position_id`; `PUT` strips any `name`/`status` fields before saving. Warrant Officers/Reserves sections still carry `{rank,title,name,status}` (out of scope for seat-linking).
- `activity_ratings`: `(officer_id, week_start UNIQUE)` pairs, rating TEXT `'0'..'5'|'LOA'`, `rated_by`, upserted via `ON CONFLICT`.
- Promotions = `POST /api/officers/:id/assign` (just changes `current_position_id`; same login, ratings history untouched). No backdating.

### Rating permission matrix (server-enforced in worker.js — the core business rule)
Rank groups: `regimental` (O-6..O-9), `battalion` (O-4/O-5), `captain` (O-3), `lieutenant` (O-1/O-2).
```js
const RATE_TARGETS = {
  regimental: ["battalion", "captain", "lieutenant"],
  battalion:  ["battalion", "captain", "lieutenant"],  // incl. battalion peers
  captain:    ["captain", "lieutenant"],               // any company incl. own
  lieutenant: [],                                      // can rate nobody
};
// No self-rating anywhere. EDIT WINDOW (added 2026-07-19, isWeekEditable()): a week is
// editable during its own 7 days plus 30 days after it ends (locked from day 37). weekStart
// must be a real, non-future Monday. GET /api/activity returns `editableWeeks`; the client
// renders dropdowns for editableWeeks ∩ canRate rows (activity-report.js).
// ADMIN OVERRIDE: officers.is_admin = 1 (migration 003, one dedicated seatless "Admin"
// account, tier regimental_command) bypasses BOTH the window and the rank matrix — can edit
// any officer, any week. Corrections audit via activity_ratings.rated_by. Normal accounts
// are never admins; the account must be flagged manually via SQL UPDATE.
// INTRA-REGIMENTAL (added 2026-07-18, canRateTarget()): within Regimental Command, rating
// follows strict rank seniority — a regimental officer can rate regimental officers of
// STRICTLY lower rank (O-8 → O-7 + O-6s; O-7 → O-6s; O-6 peers can NOT rate each other).
// No special-casing of top ranks: whoever has nobody above them is simply never rated
// (today O-8, since the O-9 seat is closed). rankIndex() parses "O-N" → N for comparison;
// resolveViewerRating() returns { group, rank } (replaced resolveViewerGroup).
```
Weeks are computed on the fly (`mondayOf()` UTC); nothing pre-generated. Quarter = calendar quarter of the *viewed* month.

### API routes (all in src/worker.js)
`GET /api/setup-status`, `POST /api/setup` (only when 0 officers), `POST /api/login`, `POST /api/logout`, `GET /api/me`, `GET|PUT /api/hierarchy`, `GET /api/positions` (flattened seats w/ occupancy for admin dropdowns), `GET|POST /api/officers`, `POST /api/officers/:id/assign`, `DELETE /api/officers/:id` (soft), `POST /api/request-reset`, `POST /api/reset-password`, `GET /api/activity?month=YYYY-MM`, `PUT /api/activity/rating`, `GET /api/server-stats` (returns `{configured:false}` if `SHEET_CSV_URL` unset; otherwise pre-aggregated totals/last7/last30/daily/weekly/growth/monthly/retention/recent).

### Production data state
8 live officer accounts, all linked to seats:
| username | display_name | seat |
|---|---|---|
| ColCurry | Curry | reg-pos-5 |
| MajGHoms | Hombrger | reg-pos-2 |
| BGenKim | Kenobi | reg-pos-3 |
| ColConnie | Connie | reg-pos-4 |
| LtColYukki | Yukki | bn-1-pos-1 |
| MajSpaceBall | SpaceBall | bn-1-pos-2 |
| CaptAlex | Alex | bn1-co-1-pos-1 |
| CaptGatto | Gatto | bn1-co-2-pos-1 |

Position id scheme: `reg-pos-1..5`, `bn-1-pos-1..2`, `bn1-co-1-pos-1..5`, `bn1-co-2-pos-1..5`, `bn-2-pos-1..2`, `bn2-co-1-pos-1..5`, `bn2-co-2-pos-1..5`. Closed: `reg-pos-1` (O-9) and everything under Battalion II.

Local D1 test accounts (local only, wiped/recreated freely): `testrc / TestPass1234` (regimental), plus testbattalion/testcaptain1/testcaptain2 with temp passwords from that session — recreate as needed.

Last commit: "Add Server Stats analytics dashboard; make login the landing page" (2026-07-18) — deployed with `SHEET_CSV_URL` prod secret set.

## 5. Current State & Active Bugs

- **No active bugs.** Project concluded 2026-07-18: Server Stats dashboard + login-first landing deployed and verified live (desktop + 375px mobile, all redirect cases curl-tested); Discord bot restarted on SparkedHost and the 10–18 Jul data gap backfilled into the sheet.
- Working tree clean apart from this CLAUDE.md documentation update.
- Note: `resolveViewerRating()` in worker.js falls back to tier-based group if an officer has no seat (seatless viewers get rank null → can never rate regimental targets); `VISIBLE_GROUPS` constant was removed when visibility opened up.

## 6. Immediate Next Steps

1. **User must pay the SparkedHost invoice before 22 Jul 2026** or the bot gets suspended again (that's what caused the 10–18 Jul outage). Bot restarted + gap backfilled 18 Jul; project concluded for now. Server Stats analytics ideas offered but not yet requested: day-of-week/hour-of-day patterns, moving average, retention curve, returning-members list, CSV export.
2. **User action pending — remind them**: create accounts in Admin for the 6 seats still showing OPEN on the live Chain of Command: Massa (`bn1-co-1-pos-2`), Skeletonpilot (`bn1-co-1-pos-3`), Mizer (`bn1-co-1-pos-4`), Eli (`bn1-co-2-pos-2`), x2Hello (`bn1-co-2-pos-3`), Hammad (`bn1-co-2-pos-4`).
3. **Bulk import of historical activity ratings** — user has an Excel "Activity Sheet" (weekly 0–5/LOA ratings, weeks starting 22/6/26) and promised to send the full export. When received: map names → officer ids, week columns → Monday ISO dates, generate INSERT statements into `activity_ratings` (respect the `UNIQUE(officer_id, week_start)` constraint), apply with `npx wrangler d1 execute 5thmr-command-hub-db --remote --file=...`. Dates in their sheet are DD/M/YY.
4. **Ideas previously suggested, not yet requested/built** (raise only if user asks for more analytics): unit-level average rollups, ↑/↓ trend indicators, "needs attention" flags for consecutive low ratings, CSV export.

### Operational reference
- Local dev: `npx wrangler d1 execute 5thmr-command-hub-db --local --file=db/schema.sql` (first time), then `npx wrangler dev --local` → http://localhost:8787.
- Remote DB queries: same command with `--remote` (works non-interactively; wrangler is OAuth-authed).
- Deploy = commit + `git push` (Workers Builds picks it up in ~60s). Never edit the D1 production data without also updating `src/seed-hierarchy.json` when the hierarchy *structure* changes.
- Browser-verify changes at mobile width too (375px) — overflow regressions have bitten twice (fixed via scroll-wrapper pattern).
